# ops-201d2-challenges
Desription:
This repository is a collection of scripts that I was tasked to write during my Ops 201 course at Code Fellows. Each day of class we were given a challenge to write a script utilizing different Bash and Powershell commands.

Purpose:
Learning these languages and how to execute their commands is essential in Computer Operations and Cyber Security. This skill set will work as a foundation while I traverse through my career path. The fundamental concepts behind these challenges were using scripts to make jobs easier, being well versed in different languages, and embracing automation.

Conclusion:
One of my favorite challenges was having to utilize a Variable and a Function in a script. Writing a script such as this has real world applications in the workplace allowing you automate simple yet redundant task increasing productivity. At this point I would like to revisit all of my scripts to see if they can be improved. I feel this will foster overall growth in my shell scripting skill set.
